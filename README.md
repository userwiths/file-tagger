This is a project ment for my personal use first. And secondly for me showing off my work in case it is required.

### Functions
    The program is ment to help keep track of different files and folders, allowing you to 'tag' them in order to organize them. The files/folders are in no way altered, they are not even opened during their tagging. The program keeps track of the tags using two files generated by itself. One has the tags with their name and value, and another has the files and their 'values'.

### How
    Tags are represented by name & value. The value represents a whole **prime** number. Once a file is tagged, it is assigned a value that is the product of the tag's values. In such way only one number can represent multiple tags for a given file, and none of the tags will collide due to the numbers being prime.

### State
    Unusable hobby project. Will try to keep adding to it and refining things, making it atleast able to be used for basic tagging. But for now, it is not in a usable state.
